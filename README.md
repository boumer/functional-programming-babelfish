This is an attempt to provide a link and comparison between similar concepts and operations and their usage between different functional programming languages . When learning and working with different languages and concepts, it's nice to have an easy way of looking up the implementations. Please contribute! I am not an expert in these languages. Please contribute to improvements with PR's and issues to help improve this reference.
